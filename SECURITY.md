# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities via [email](mailto:admin@dries007.net).
For good measure please send me a direct message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eKmdnup) as well.

Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publically without prior approval.

I'll try to at least respond to reports within 3 days.
I cannot offer you money in exchange for finding bugs, but I can thank you on the website or here on GitHub if you want.
